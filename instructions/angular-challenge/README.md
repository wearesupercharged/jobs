# Javascript Engineer Challenge

Thank you for your interest in the Supercharged Software Engineer team! This project gives us a chance to see your Javascript programming skills.

Please complete this challenge and make your repository accessible to:

- [iamsupercharged](https://github.com/iamsupercharged) (rayan@supercharged.gg)


**App Replication**

Build an Angular app that replicates the look and behavior of the given example (or borderlands.mp4 found in same directory): 

![](borderlands.gif)

The full functioning overlay can be found by visiting [the Borderlands 3 category on Twitch's website](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Borderlands 3) and click any live stream. There is no need for the actual views to be interactive. 

It is up to you to decide which other details you'd want to implement.

Feel free to include any new features you can come up with.

## Other Tips

- Consider how to set up the perfect base to eventually keep your code structure as the project's front-end base.
- Consider how data will be fetched and displayed on screen.

**SETUP**
Clone the current repo, npm install and get going! Good luck!
