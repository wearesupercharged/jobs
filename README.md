# Supercharged Engineering Challenges

## Instructions
Create a new private GitHub repository and push your commits to it as you are completing the challenge.

Once you are ready, please push your code and allow access to iamsupercharged detailed [here](instructions/angular-challenge).

Please include a short introduction about yourself in the README.

Don't hesitate to ask us questions. Displaying creativity is a bonus in all challenges.

## What We Look For

### Code Consistency
The code should be consistently formatted. Consistent code reduces syntax related distractions and helps us focus on the important logic. Use a code linter if necessary to help you spot these inconsistencies.

### Variable Naming Clarity
We should be able to understand the logic of code blocks by reading the names of variables and functions. A clearly named variable means we won't need to look up the definition of the variable or function right away in order to understand what it does.

### Useful Comments
A comment should be used in cases where the code cannot be formatted to fix clarity. The comment should allow us to skip over code blocks when looking for an overview of the code. We can come back later to the smaller bits of code to confirm they do what the comment says.

### Unit Tests
Write unit tests for critical parts of your app. The process of writing tests for your code also reminds you of input cases that you may have missed before.
